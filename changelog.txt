#####v1.45global##### // Grish
- various minor bug fixes/improvements
- improved maptimes g|global command (although still not perfect!) now lists top times from all servers as a summary, with the option to "drill" into the top 15 for any given server
- map ent sync will now download ALL mapsent/mapname.* and ent/mapname.* files
- added: download the map .bsp file from a nominated web-server (url) when running the admin cmd: addmap <mapname> (if the map isn't on the local FS already)
- added: dual scoreboard (local and global) is presented at the intermission for q2pro clients (r1q2 still just shows the local due to limitations with on screen ascii chars)
- added: boot/kick users who change their cl_maxpackets outside of: 0, 20-120 ranges (helps prevents lagged/buggy replays ala thewill33)
- added: flood control for spamming throwup/addball abuse (which could previously result in overflowing and crashing a server!)
- remote replay/score files are no longer kept on the FS after a map change
- note on the version control/numbering: I maintain the source in a private repo, then occasionally sync with the public repo. Hence the major bump in version numbers..
- see http://kex.q2jump.net/global for official q2jump global scores/ranks etc. Contact Grish if you run your own server, and would like to include your data on the website

        set to 0 to disable all global integration features immediately (default: 0)
    global_ents_sync "1"
        download jump/mapsent and jump/ent files on each map spawn. Note: this will replace any local mapsent/ent files! (default: 0)

        base url to server hosting "jump/mapsent" and "jump/ent" directories (default: "")
    global_localhost_name "crikey!" (default: server hostname cvar)
        custom display name for your local server, default: $hostname cvar

        faster downloads with more threads (default: 5 max: 15)
    global_port_[1..5] "27910"
        jump/<portdir> where the maptimes.t and users.t files are stored (default: "27910")
    global_name_[1..5] "kex"             
        label for remote server name (default: "default" Note: It's best to leave as "default" for any unconfigured global hosts)
    global_url_[1..5] "http://<kex ip>/quake2/jump"
        base url to remote jump dir for jump/<portdir> and jump/jumpdemo access (no trailing slash, default: "")

    1) Full global maptime/demo resync on every map spawn
    2) New time set that qualifies a place on the top15 global board
    3) remtime/remalltimes commands where the deleted time/s was on the global board
    4) Name highlighting for all connected players with a top15 time

  when antiglue is 2 and a user turns on antiglue, they will be prevented from setting a 1st place time
